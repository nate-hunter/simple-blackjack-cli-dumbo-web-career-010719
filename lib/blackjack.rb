  # Once you get all of the tests in the first part of the test suite passing, you have built the building blocks of our blackjack game. Now, we need to put them all together in the #runner method. The #runner method is responsible for enacting the game play until the user loses. Remember that a player loses if the sum of their cards exceeds 21.

  # Here's how we want our game to run:

  # Welcome the user
  # Deal them their first two cards, i.e. their initial_round
  # Ask them if they want to hit or stay
  # If they want to hit, deal another card
  # If they want to stay, ask them again!
  # If their card total exceeds 21, the game ends.
  # Use a loop constructor (I'd recommend until, but that is by no means your only option) to enact the above game play in the #runner method. Then, check out the lib/runner.rb file. Notice that it is simply calling the #runner method. The runner file will call the #runner method which should in turn utilize all the other methods you built!
